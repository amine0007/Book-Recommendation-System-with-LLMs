# Book-Recommendation-System-with-LLMs

This repository contains the code for an end-to-end book recommendation system built using Python and large language models (LLMs). The project follows the tutorial by JetBrains, demonstrating a content-based recommendation approach.

# About the Project
This project leverages the power of LLMs to analyze book data and provide personalized recommendations. It's designed to be a practical, real-world example of applying modern NLP techniques to a common recommendation task. The system takes a user's query and suggests books that are not only topically similar but also match a specific tone or style.

# Key Features
Content-Based Recommendations: Generates book suggestions based on the content of a user's query.

LLM Integration: Utilizes large language models to understand the topic and emotional tone of book descriptions.

Vector Search: Employs vector embeddings to efficiently find books with similar characteristics.

Data Cleaning Pipeline: Includes a robust process for cleaning and preparing raw text data, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

End-to-End Workflow: Demonstrates the complete pipeline from data ingestion and model building to providing final recommendations.

# Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

Hugging Face: For accessing and utilizing open-source LLMs.

LangChain: A framework for building applications with LLMs, used to streamline the workflow.

Transformers: The library that provides pre-trained models for various NLP tasks.
